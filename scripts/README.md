Imagine that for compliance reasons you need to implement the following _policies_ at different times:

[use case 1](https://github.com/mariocuomo/informationBarriers/tree/main/scripts/use%20case%201)
- [ ] The _treasury_ department cannot communicate externally<br>

- [ ] Chosen _elite_ students you want to isolate them to work on a secret project<br>
[use case 3](https://github.com/mariocuomo/informationBarriers/tree/main/scripts/use%20case%203)
