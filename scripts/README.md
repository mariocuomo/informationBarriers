</div>

Imagine that for compliance reasons you need to implement the following _policies_ at different times:

- [ ] The departments of _literature_ and _engineering_ cannot communicate directly with the _administration_<br>
[use case 1]()
- [ ] The _treasury_ department cannot communicate externally<br>
[use case 2]()
- [ ] Chosen _elite_ students you want to isolate them to work on a secret project<br>
[use case 3]()
